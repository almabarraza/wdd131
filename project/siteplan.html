                <p>The name for this site is Plant Care Green Leaf. The name will be in the title in the html structure,
                    it also will

                <p>This site will allow the user to understand better the care of plants. In this site the user will
                    find photos of a

                <h3>Scenarios</h3>
                <p>Two scenarios are provided for this web site in the home page. The first one answer the question that
                    maybe could ask
                    the user, and it is: Why my plant leaves are turning yellow? To answer that question, I will create
                    a section in the
                    home page that will show the topic in an h2 that will say “Plant Issues and How to Solve Them”. This
                    will have a
                    sub-topic in a div with a h3 tag that will say “Yellow Leaves” and will explain how to solve the
                    problem in
                    a paragraph. Fort the second question that maybe could ask the user could be “How could I supports
                    the healthy
                    development in my plant?”. The answer for this question could be “Compost as a Natural Fertilizer”.
                    This topic will be in a h3 tag inside a section, and there will be a div with the sub-topic in a h2
                    that will
                    say “The Power of The Compost to Your Plants” and then will be a paragraph with a paragraph that
                    will be showing information regards this sub-topic.</p>
